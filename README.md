# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Description
In this challenge, I built a set of APIs for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize npm packages for authentication.
